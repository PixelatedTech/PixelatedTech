**Code. Create. Crash.**  

Student at NTU, pursuing a degree in *Artificial Intelligence and Society*. 

I push boundaries, break things, and rebuild them better. My work spans AI, Data Analytics, Automation, and NLP/ML/DL, where I apply  tech to solve real-world problems.

With hands-on experience through internships and personal projects, I've developed both technical and adaptive skills that keep evolving. I move fast, think sharp, and build with intent.

Always open to new challenges, meaningful collaboration, and projects that demand clarity, depth, and impact.
